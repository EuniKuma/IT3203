            <h1>Web Evolution</h1>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web is something that most of us use every single day without thinking too much about how it all began. It is easy to 
                mix up the World Wide Web with the Internet, but they are not the same thing. The Internet is a massive network of computers all over 
                the world, and the Web is a way to access information on that network through pages, images, links, and other features (Kartik, 
                2024; Jasuja, n.d.). Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN when he came up with the idea that 
                people should be able to share information with each other more easily. He created a system that used web pages, hyperlinks, and a 
                special language called HTML so that documents could be connected and viewed from anywhere (Owen, 2014). This invention would later 
                grow into the World Wide Web we all know today.
