            <!-- HTTP protocol -->
            <h2>The HTTP Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web relies on an underlying communication system called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
                HTTP is a set of rules that browsers (clients) and servers use to talk to each other. For example, when you
                type a URL into your browser and press enter, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the
                server finds the webpage and sends back an HTTP response. Your browser then displays the page. HTTP is a
                <em>stateless</em> protocol, meaning it does not remember anything from one request to the next. This
                initially made it difficult to have features like login sessions or shopping carts because the Web would not
                automatically "remember" you. To solve this, web developers started using cookies to help websites keep
                track of users and create more interactive, personal experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, HTTP has been improved to handle the growing demands of the Web. After the original
                HTTP/1.0, a revised version HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections and became the standard for many
                years. More recently, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 were developed to make web browsing faster and more efficient (MDN
                Web Docs, 2024). These newer versions allow multiple requests to happen in parallel and include other
                optimizations. Together with improvements in web browsers and server technology, these protocols help
                websites load quicker and support the rich content we use today. Security also became a priority; HTTPS
                (HTTP Secure) was introduced to encrypt data for safe online banking, shopping, and other sensitive
                activities.

            <h2>Web 2.0 and Social Media</h2>
            <p>
                Around the early 2000s, the Web underwent a major transformation often referred to as <strong>Web
                2.0</strong>. During this era, the Web shifted from a place where most people just read information into
                a platform where users could actively create and share content. New types of websites appeared, such as
                social networks, wikis, blogs, and video-sharing sites, that allowed anyone to publish content and
                collaborate with others (Christensson, 2008). Instead of just reading a news site, users were now posting on
                forums, commenting on articles, sharing photos and videos, and connecting with friends online. Websites like
                Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, which emerged during the mid-2000s, became extremely popular and
                demonstrated how interactive and social the Web had become.

                        Today, the World Wide Web continues to evolve as more people around the globe come online and use it in
                        their daily lives. Each year, internet traffic grows as more devices and users connect to the Web (Cisco
                        Annual Internet Report 2022). We now access the Web not just on desktop computers, but on laptops,
                        smartphones, and even smart TVs. With each click or tap, an HTTP request and response happens in the
                        background almost instantly, something we hardly even think about thanks to how seamless the experience is.
                        It is remarkable that in just a few decades we went from simple text-only pages to a rich ecosystem of
                        applications, videos, and social networks accessible at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of this is built on the foundations laid in the early days of the Web. Core technologies like HTML and
                        HTTP are still at the heart of every website, though they have been refined and expanded. For instance,
                        without HTTP as a common language between browsers and servers, we would not be able to load pages so easily
                        across the world. Innovations like HTTPS have added important security, ensuring that our data stays safe as
                        it travels the Internet. Looking back at everything from Tim Berners-Lee's first webpage to the explosion of
                        user-generated content in the Web 2.0 era, it's clear that the Web has transformed tremendously. Understanding 
                        how the Web works and its history helps us appreciate how far we've come. The Web has become an essential part 
                        of daily life, whether we're sharing memes, streaming music, or doing schoolwork, and it will certainly continue 
                        to grow and change in the future.
